# python_projects
I want to review and learn new Python concepts.
This is best done through *learning by doing*, so I'll start by writing small Python programs.
For this, I'm using the book **_The Big Book of Small Python Projects_** by *Al Sweigart*.

## overview
### chapter1
#### [0_bagels](./chapter1/0_bagels/)
A number-guessing game, similar to the High-Low game.
#### [1_birthday_paradox](./chapter1/1_birthday_paradox/)
Simulates the birthday paradox â€” the surprisingly high probability that, even in a small group of people, two individuals share the same birthday.
#### [2_bitmap_message](./chapter1/2_bitmap_message/)
Prints a predefined picture using a given input string.
#### [3_black_jack](./chapter1/3_black_jack/)
Console implementation of the famous gambling game called Blackjack or 21.
#### [4_bouncing_logo](./chapter1/4_bouncing_logo/)
Recreates the classic DVD recorder standby screen, with the option to have multiple logos at once.
There are two versions:
- One behaves like the original.
- The other leaves visible trails behind moving logos by not erasing previous positions.
#### [5_caesar_cipher](./chapter1/5_caesar_cipher/)
A way to encrypt messages by shifting the alphabet by a specific number (key).
Decryption is done by shifting the encrypted message by the same key just in the opposite direction.
#### [6_aesar_hacker](./chapter1/6_caesar_hacker/)
Demonstrates how easy it is to crack a Caesar cipher by generating and printing all possible shifts.
This reveals the correct message somewhere among the results.
#### [7_calendar_maker](./chapter1/7_calendar_maker/)
Neatly prints a calendar for a given date in the console.
#### [8_carrot_in_a_box](./chapter1/8_carrot_in_a_box/)
A two-player bluffing game. Each
#### [9_cho_han](./chapter1/9_cho_han/)
A simple Japanese dice game in which the player bets on whether the sum of two dice is even ("Cho") or odd ("Han").
### chapter2
#### [10_headline_generator](./chapter2/10_headline_generator/)
Creates automatically random headlines.
#### [11_collatz_sequence](./chapter2/11_collatz_sequence/)
Create the collatz sequence just input integer >=1.
#### [12_game_of_life](./chapter2/12_game_of_life/)
Implementation of the game of life.
